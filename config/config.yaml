# Input / Output
schema_file: schema/scenario.xsd # Path of the XML schema definition file (this file is used to verify that an input scenario.xml is valid)
schema_validation_active: True # This parameter is used to activate the schema validation (if set to False, performance will increase slightly)
prettify_output: True # If set to True, any .xml file generated by this simulator (whether it's a result or a random scenario) will be well-formatted (if set to False, performance will increase slightly)

# Logging
log_level: INFO # Defines how detailed logging messages you want to receive - you can set it to DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or ERROR (DEBUG will give most information, while ERROR will only notify you about errors)

# Visualization
visualization_active: True # If set to True you will see an animation of the simulation (if set to False, performance will increase massively - True shall only be used for validation and development, never when you need fast results as in evolutional algorithms)
visualization_frame_time: 0.0000 # Sets the waiting time between to animation pictures in seconds
visualization_axis_enabled: True # Only applicable to 3D mode. Enable 3D x,y,z axis during simulation visualization
visualization_show_nodes: False # If set to True, network nodes will be displayed in the visualization
visualization_3D_active: False # If set to True, the simulation will be 3D (slow), if set to False, it will be 2D (birds perspective) (significantly faster)

# Simulation
slot_resolution: 1 # Each link consists of cells - This parameter defines how many cells there should be per distance unit (usually meter)

# Battery model
battery_model: "battery_model_height_difference" # Sets the battery model. Can be either "battery_model_height_difference" or "battery_model_simple"

# The discharge factors apply if the "battery_model_height_difference" is set
# They define, how much vertical and horizontal movement discharge the battery
# The vertical discharge factor should be higher than the horizontal discharge factor because a motion upward needs more energy than a motion horizontally
vertical_discharge_factor: 1
horizontal_discharge_factor: 0.1

# Risk calculation
risk_calculation_enabled: True # If set to True, risk of agent collision will be calculated during the simulation and saved in the output.xml
risk_checking_radius: 200 # The risk checking radius is the radius of the area around an agent that is checked for other agents

# Loudness calculation
loudness_calculation_enabled: True # If set to True, loudness of links will be calculated during the simulation and saved in the output.xml

# Random network generation properties
# The settings below only apply if you execute the simulator with the --random True flag set (eg. python3.8 CommandLineInterface.py --random True)
# The simulator will then generate random networks
random_scenario_diameter: 1000 # Defines the radius of the network to be generated
random_scenario_node_connection_radius: 400 # Every node will connect to all other nodes within this radius. If this setting is bigger than the "random_scenario_diameter", the network will be a fully connected graph.
random_scenario_number_of_nodes: 25 # Defines the number of nodes in the random mode
random_scenario_number_of_agents: 15 # Defines the number of agents in the random mode
random_scenario_agent_minimum_speed: 1 # Defines the minimum speed of an agent during simulation
random_scenario_agent_maximum_speed: 20 # Defines the maximum speed of an agent during simulation
random_scenario_link_capacity: 50 # Defines the capacity of a link in a randomly generated network
